# OnionsOS
This is a simple operating system with a filesystem, apps, and memory analysis. It is a simple OS that I put together for fun, though it is quite good.
It has abunch of basic commands for you to use, it will display them with use of the "help" command, you can also access the apps availible for it using the "apps" command
though their really aren't alot.
